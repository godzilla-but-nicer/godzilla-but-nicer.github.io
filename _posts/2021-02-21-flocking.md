Spontaneous collective behavior has long interested researchers due to its
mystery and ubiquity; birds form and maintain flocks, fireflies blink in unison,
funny and cool humans do the wave at public events. Here we will take a look at
some of the systems that produce these behaviors.

## Reynold's Boids

In 1987, a computer graphics researcher named Craig Reynolds published his
attempt to get inside the head of a flocking bird. He wanted to make good
animations of flocks and thought that a bottom up approach might work better
than trying to script the trajectories of each individual. Reynolds built what
we would now call an agent based model (ABM) of “bird-oid” objects, or boids.
Each boid’s motion is updated by three driving rules:

1. Separation: boids try to maintain some minimum distance between itself and its neighbors
1. Alignment: boids try to match the average direction of motion of its neighbors
1. Cohesion: boids try to place themselves in the center of all of its neighbors

A lot of people have built their own version (a very nice 2D example with some
extra parameters is available [here](https://boids.cubedhuang.com/)) but the
boids model is actually pretty complex because of its emphasis on computer
graphics. Reynolds considers variable speeds, banking on turns, and pathing for
the overall flock. Features like these led to its use in actual animation.
Supposedly boids are in Half-Life (but I think they used the name on a simpler
model) and have been in movies like [Batman
Returns](https://youtu.be/zYiKA-mQ0e8?t=103).

## Simplifications of boids

Later, in the ’90s, physicists got interested in this problem as well. Being
physicists they made simplifying assumptions, eliminated some of the features in
Reynolds’ models that mostly benefitted animators. In the simplification
presented by Tamas Vicsek and his coauthors in Vicsek *et al.* 1995 we drop the
cute stuff. Boids are now “self-driven particles”, they don’t care about
separation or cohesion, only alignment. They also move at a constant speed, are
free to collide with one another, and exist only in toroidal 2D space of finite
size. To keep things spicy, these particles (lets keep calling them boids) don’t
perfectly align to their neighbor’s average velocity; they are subject to noise
in the form of offset from the calculated average.

An advantage of this simplification is that we can write down equations for our
boids!

Their position is updated with the difference equation:

$$ \mathbf{x_i}(t+1) = \mathbf{x_i}(t) + \mathbf{v_i}(t)\Delta t $$

The vector $\mathbf{v_i}$ has a constant magnitude for all boids and changes
only in angle. The angle updates by:

$$ \theta (t+1) = \langle \theta (t) \rangle_r + \delta \theta $$

he average is over the angles of all boids within a fixed radius $r$ and $\delta
\theta$ represents the noise drawn from a uniform interval $[-\frac{\eta}{2},
\frac{\eta}{2}]$.

So what do we see? Does it still work without all of the details?

It depends! For some (low) values of the noise parameter $\eta$ and with few
enough boids in the system we see flocking. As noise is increased the flocking
patterns fall apart and the boids move around in a completely disorganized way
that is completely rotationally symmetrical. In fact, this system shows a phase
transition in both the noise $\eta$ and the density $\rho$ of boids . In the
disordered phase, the total sum velocity is zero. The rotational symmetry
ensures there is no net movement. In the [ordered
phase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj9L70Fh9PM) this symmetry is broken, a
direction is chosen by the system and net movement occurs.

It should be noted that the ordered phase does not correspond to flocking
exactly. At the extremes of the ordered phase our boids essentially just move
cleanly in the arbitrary direction without forming the complex clusters we
associate with flocking.

As it turns out however, Vicsek et al. and even Reynolds were wrong about how
birds decided who to mimic. In 2008 another group of physicists led by Michele
Ballerini collected some amazing data about flocks of birds. Using steroscopic
imaging (two cameras) the team was able to track the locations of thousands of
birds in ten different flocks in 3D.

What they found was that for any bird in the flock there was a statistical
pattern for the relative position of its nearest neighbor, and the next nearest
neighbor, and the one after that, and so on. At about the sixth or seventh
nearest neighbor the pattern vanished. The flocking birds aren’t mimicking any
sufficiently close bird but rather the 6 or 7 closest birds, however close they
might be.

Ballerini et al. call this nearest neighbor distance “topological” distance as
opposed to metric distance where a bird considers any other bird within a
particular physical radius. As a test of their hypothesis they plug this
topological distance in to the simplified Vicsek et al. boids model. They find
that flocking maintained with topological distance are more resilient and better
able to maintain themselves at variable density than flocks using metric
distance.

The model presented in Vicsek et al. 1995 has been extended as a model of many
different things including people panicking to leave a building in an emergency,
traffic, and as a guiding principle from drone swarms.

## Threshold Behaviors

A chance to do “the wave” is the main appeal of going to a basketball game to
me. In Farkas *et al.* 2002, a small team of funny scientists (members of
Vicsek’s research group as it turns out) built a computational model of the wave
that worked like this: each person in the crowd is ready and willing to wave if
enough people in nearby seats are currently waving. Each individual has their
own threshold and is more inclined to look to their left than their right. After
waving each individual enters a refractory period during which they will not
wave not matter how much their neighbors are waving.

From this model we learn that collective behaviors that depend on threshold
activation also depend on large groups of initial participants. On average once
we’ve started the wave will continue because we will always be activating enough
wavers to hit the average threshold.

This wave example is just one of many examples of threshold models of collective
behavior that have a long history in the social sciences. A classic example is
Granovetter’s riot model from 1978 in which each member of a crowd has some
threshold after which they will start breaking shit. They look to the rest of
the crowd and remain calm until the number of rioting crowd members exceeds
their threshold. Models like Farkas’ are really just the riot with additional
characteristics. Instead of the whole crowd, potential wavers look at their
neighbors. Rioters don’t stop once they’ve started wrecking up the place, while
wavers only wave for a set amount of time. Finally, Farkas’ wave model shows
anisotropy, a directional bias, because potential wavers look more to their
neighbors on the left than on their right.

## Synchronization

Spontaneous synchronization is another classic example of collective behavior.
The theory of synchronization often uses the Kuromoto model of coupled
oscillators. In this model, a population of oscillators–think blinking fireflies
or a clapping audience–each tries to oscillate with its own natural frequency
but is pulled toward the frequencies of other oscillators in the population.
Like the Vicsek flocking model where a group direction appeared with low enough
noise, the Kuromoto oscillator shows a phase transition where with sufficiently
strong coupling, a group frequency emerges.

Another group of scientists of which Tamas Vicsek is also somehow a member
studied the emergence of synchronization in applause empirically. They find that
when unison occurs, it occurs with a sudden drop of the participants clapping
frequency (and variance) that than decays back into incoherence. This pattern
would be consistent with a Kuromoto model situation if the coupling strength
were changing in time.
