## Academic Projects

### Dormancy in 2D discrete dynamical systems
January 2022 - December 2023

Advisor: Jay Lennon
- Implemented 2D cellular automaton models to run in parallel using Rust and 
  characterized statistical differences in outcomes for different models.
- Produced observations consistent with current theoretical understanding of 
  dormancy and illustrated specific patterns we should expect in empirical data.

### Predicting complex traits in metagenomes
May 2020 - January 2022

Advisor: Jay Lennon
- Leveraged database of thousands of publically available metagenomes to 
  develop random forest classifier for baterial genomes capacity to enter 
  dormancy.
- Enabled further discovery and testing of evolutionary theory by all current
  and future members of the lab.

### Testing multivariate information theory methodology
February 2020 - May 2021

Advisor: Luis Rocha
- Generated synthetic time series data from networks with known hypergraph 
  structures and evaluated several multivariate information theoretic methods 
  for their ability to uncover these structures.
- Showed that multivariate information theoretic methods can predict some
  dynamical features while casting doubt on the ability of these tools to 
  reveal underlying structure.
